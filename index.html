                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
                Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
                there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
                the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
                course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
                special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
                the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
                warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
                and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
                diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
                REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
                double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio
                astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang,
                and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                right.

                <p>
                    Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
                    time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
                    John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                    detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
                    waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
                    when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                    inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
                    correct. Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
                    though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
                    proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
                    science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the
                    universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms
                    of time and space and energy to science and speculation. Confirming
                    inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
                    light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is
                    only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                    architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
                    universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
                    into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

            <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of
                particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be
                the first direct
                observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should
                ruffle
                space-time.

                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said, “This is
                huge, as big as it gets.”

                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                gravitational waves.”

                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates space and
                preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic Extragalactic
                Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on
                Monday and in a set
                of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <h3>The Theory Of Inflation</h3>
            <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe
                expanded so
                uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

                            might want to look for
                            another explanation.

                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
                in 10 million. Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,”
                saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his
                lifetime. “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we
                have been lucky.” The results are the closely guarded distillation of
                three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for
                fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
                select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was
                sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week. “It was a very
                special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said
                Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
                telescopes. Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first
                described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic
                inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last
                week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr.
                Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell
                him the news.

            <p>
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
                anything. “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that
                this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but
                I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
                wrote in an email. Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island,
                Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this
                is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said. By last weekend, as
                social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
                news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation
                and caution. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email,
                “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the
                greatest discoveries in the history of science.” John E. Carlstrom of
                the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
                impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he
                said. Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to
                inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
                genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his
                model, but he expressed reservations about inflation. Lawrence M.
                Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
                confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates
                based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European
                Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the
                universe. “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and
                down,” Dr. Krauss said. Corroboration might not be long in coming. The
                Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a
                dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
                mountaintops and space.

                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
                cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
                and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
                waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series
                of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
                the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are
                Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
                California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford. “The South
                Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,”
                Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in
                1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
                radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
                preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another. This was a
                step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves
                from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and
                stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
                polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of
                the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in
                spirals. Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally
                small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
                telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
                “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The
                strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
                year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had
                things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
                breakthrough.

            <h2>A Special Time</h2>
            <p>
                The data traced the onset of inflation to
                a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto
                house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the
                evolution of the universe. Physicists recognize four forces at work in
                the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak
                nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply
                different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the
                universe in its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe cooled,
                according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old
                folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The
                laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
                That was where Dr. Guth came in. Under some circumstances, a glass of
                water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until
                it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing
                latent heat. Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a
                unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued
                with a mysterious latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s equations,
                the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe
                would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the
                repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed
                apart. What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
                least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
                primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
                eye-blink. Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
                ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was
                still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky
                and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there
                is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the
                universe might be the ultimate free lunch.” Make that free lunches.
                Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
                vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our
                own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest
                of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
                endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse. So the future of the
                cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
                going any deeper into the past. We might never know what happened
                before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
                everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the
                primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view. “If you
                trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
                astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
