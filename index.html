            <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world
                of known
                physics.

                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in the Big
                Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in
                the presumed
                course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
                repulsive force, causing
                the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not like a
                jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those
                particles were
                not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the Big Bang, and
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
